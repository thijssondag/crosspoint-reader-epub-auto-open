# CrossPoint Reader

## This fork: quick “receive & open” for Send to X4

This repository is **[CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader)** with a small set of changes so you can **push EPUBs from your phone to the reader and have the book open immediately**—a great match for **[Send to X4](https://www.chapiware.com/send-to-x4/)** (Android / iOS / browser) by **Chapiware**: install the app, join the **same Wi‑Fi** as the X4 running this firmware, send an article or EPUB, and the device can grab the file and jump straight into the reader without digging through the file browser.

**Disclaimer — use at your own risk**

The changes in this fork were developed with help from **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** (AI-assisted editing in Cursor IDE). This is **unofficial** firmware: **you use it entirely at your own risk**. There is **no warranty**; neither the maintainer(s) nor Cursor are responsible for bricked devices, data loss, security issues, or any other harm. Keep a recovery path (e.g. official CrossPoint or stock firmware flashing) before you experiment.

**Why we changed the firmware**

- **Send to X4** talks to the reader over **local Wi‑Fi** (no cloud). CrossPoint already exposes a web file transfer UI; we wanted that flow to be **one gesture on the device** and **one less step after upload** (open the book automatically).
- We use **station (STA) mode**: the reader **joins your remembered Wi‑Fi** (same network as the phone), not a device hotspot, which matches how Send to X4 expects to reach the X4 on your LAN.

**What we added (summary)**

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **Gesture** | **Long-press Back** (~2s) from most screens starts **Quick File Transfer** (won’t double-fire while you’re in the Wi‑Fi picker or keyboard). |
| **Network** | Opens **`WifiSelectionActivity`** with **auto-connect** to the **last saved** network when possible; otherwise the normal network list. |
| **After upload** | **`CrossPointWebServer`** accepts an optional **upload callback**; the first completed upload triggers **`goToReader(path)`** so the EPUB (or other supported file) **opens immediately**. |
| **UI** | **Full white clear** before drawing the transfer screen so the previous UI doesn’t ghost on e‑ink. |
| **Plumbing** | `ActivityManager::goToQuickFileTransfer()`, `Activity::blocksQuickFileTransferHotkey()` so sub-flows aren’t interrupted by the global long-press. |

**Upstream & license**

- All original CrossPoint code and docs remain **MIT** and belong to the **CrossPoint** project and its contributors.
- This fork is for personal/convenience use; **send kudos to [Chapiware](https://www.chapiware.com/send-to-x4/)** for Send to X4.

**Repository mirror note**

This GitHub repo may ship **without** the upstream `.github/` folder (issue templates, Actions workflows) so it can be pushed from tools that lack GitHub’s `workflow` OAuth scope. For CI and release automation, copy `.github` from **[crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader)** or push with a token that includes **`workflow`** scope.

Firmware for the **Xteink X4** e-paper display reader (unaffiliated with Xteink).
Built using **PlatformIO** and targeting the **ESP32-C3** microcontroller.

CrossPoint Reader is a purpose-built firmware designed to be a drop-in, fully open-source replacement for the official 
Xteink firmware. It aims to match or improve upon the standard EPUB reading experience.

![](./docs/images/cover.jpg)

## Motivation

E-paper devices are fantastic for reading, but most commercially available readers are closed systems with limited 
customisation. The **Xteink X4** is an affordable, e-paper device, however the official firmware remains closed.
CrossPoint exists partly as a fun side-project and partly to open up the ecosystem and truly unlock the device's
potential.

CrossPoint Reader aims to:
* Provide a **fully open-source alternative** to the official firmware.
* Offer a **document reader** capable of handling EPUB content on constrained hardware.
* Support **customisable font, layout, and display** options.
* Run purely on the **Xteink X4 hardware**.

This project is **not affiliated with Xteink**; it's built as a community project.

## Features & Usage

- [x] EPUB parsing and rendering (EPUB 2 and EPUB 3)
- [x] Image support within EPUB

## Installing

### Web (latest firmware)

1. Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Go to https://xteink.dve.al/ and click "Flash CrossPoint firmware"

To revert back to the official firmware, you can flash the latest official firmware from https://xteink.dve.al/, or swap
back to the other partition using the "Swap boot partition" button here https://xteink.dve.al/debug.

### Web (specific firmware version)

1. Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C
2. Download the `firmware.bin` file from the release of your choice via the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases)
3. Go to https://xteink.dve.al/ and flash the firmware file using the "OTA fast flash controls" section

To revert back to the official firmware, you can flash the latest official firmware from https://xteink.dve.al/, or swap
back to the other partition using the "Swap boot partition" button here https://xteink.dve.al/debug.

### Command line (specific firmware version)

1. Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) :
```bash
pip install esptool

3. Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C.
4. Note the device location. On Linux, run `dmesg` after connecting. On MacOS, run :
```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit"' --info
```
5. Flash the firmware :
```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin
```
Change `/dev/ttyACM0` to the device for your system.

### Manual

See [Development](#development) below.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* **PlatformIO Core** (`pio`) or **VS Code + PlatformIO IDE**
* Python 3.8+
* USB-C cable for flashing the ESP32-C3
* Xteink X4

### Checking out the code

CrossPoint uses PlatformIO for building and flashing the firmware. To get started, clone the repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader

# Or, if you've already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Flashing your device

Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C and run the following command.

```sh
pio run --target upload
```
### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```
after that run the script:
```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```
Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## Internals

CrossPoint Reader is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only
has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based
on this constraint.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the 
cache. This cache directory exists at `.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:


```
.crosspoint/
├── epub_12471232/       # Each EPUB is cached to a subdirectory named `epub_<hash>`
│   ├── progress.bin     # Stores reading progress (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # Book cover image (once generated)
│   ├── book.bin         # Book metadata (title, author, spine, table of contents, etc.)
│   └── sections/        # All chapter data is stored in the sections subdirectory
│       ├── 0.bin        # Chapter data (screen count, all text layout info, etc.)
│       ├── 1.bin        #     files are named by their index in the spine
│       └── ...
│
└── epub_189013891/
```

Deleting the `.crosspoint` directory will clear the entire cache. 

Due the way it's currently implemented, the cache is not automatically cleared when a book is deleted and moving a book
file will use a new cache directory, resetting the reading progress.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the [file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).
